The General Lake Model (GLM), an open-source, one-dimensional hydrodynamic model, was used to simulate physical, chemical, and biological variables in Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, Virginia, USA between 15 May 2013 and 31 December 2019. GLM (v.3.2.0a3) was coupled to the Aquatic EcoDynamics (AED) module library via the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Modeling (FABM). GLM-AED requires three configuration files to run the model. First, the glm3.nml file configures lake metadata (including hypsometry), meteorological driver data, stream inflow and outflow driver data files, and physical response variables (mixing parameters and sediment heat zones). Second, the aed2_20210204_2DOCpools.nml file configures various biogeochemical modules for the simulation of oxygen, carbon, silica, nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter, and phytoplankton. Third, the aed2_phyto_pars_30June2020.nml file configures all parameters pertaining to phytoplankton dynamics. Meteorological data, two surface stream inflow files, a submerged oxygenation inflow file, and outflow file used in this calibration are also included.
