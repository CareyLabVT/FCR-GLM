This text describes the 1) driver data, 2) model configuration, and 3) model calibration, with 4) references at the end.

1) Driver data

GLM-AED requires three driver datasets: meteorological data; inflow stream data (which consists of discharge, water temperature, and chemistry); and outflow water discharge. We developed each of these driver datasets for Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) for 15 May 2013 to 31 December 2019, as detailed below.

Meteorological driver data: 
GLM-AED was forced with hourly meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave and longwave radiation, wind speed, and precipitation) from NASA's North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2; Xia et al. 2012) for FCR. 

Inflow stream driver data: 
We developed driver datasets of daily discharge and water temperature for the two primary surface streams entering into FCR, Falling Creek "weir stream" and Tunnel Branch "wetland stream," from manually-collected data and sensor observations from 2013-2019. The total discharge and temperature of Tunnel Branch, the largest stream that enters into FCR, were measured continuously throughout the study period at a weir with pressure sensors measuring every 15 minutes (Carey et al. 2021a). 

Falling Creek, the smaller stream entering into FCR, was monitored less regularly than the larger inflow and did not have a weir, so its daily total discharge was summed from separate models that calculated precipitation-driven flow and baseflow. First, we estimated daily precipitation-driven flow for both Falling Creek and Tunnel Branch using a simple hydrological model based on their delineated watershed areas and NLDAS-2 precipitation and air temperature (following Ward et al. 2020). Second, we subtracted the modeled daily precipitation-driven flow from total discharge measured at the Tunnel Branch weir to estimate its daily baseflow. Third, we compared baseflow data collected manually in both streams using flowmeters and salt injection on n=19 days without any recent precipitation in 2019 (Carey et al. 2019), and calculated the mean ratio of baseflow in Falling Creek to Tunnel Branch from those 19 days of data. Fourth, we then multiplied that ratio by the daily baseflow in Tunnel Branch to calculate daily baseflow in Falling Creek. Finally, we summed Falling Creek's daily baseflow and its daily precipitation-driven flow to calculate daily total discharge for that stream. 

Water temperature was measured at an upstream littoral site in FCR near where Falling Creek entered the reservoir on approximately the same frequency as the lacustrine monitoring (Carey et al. 2021b). This littoral temperature dataset was linearly interpolated and used to calculate Falling Creek's daily inflow temperature. 

The inflow water chemistry driver data for Tunnel Branch and Falling Creek were determined from manual grab sample observations (Carey et al. 2021c). Both streams are well-mixed, so their dissolved oxygen concentrations were estimated assuming 100% saturation using the rMR package (Moulton 2018). Surface grab samples at Tunnel Branch for NO3-, NH4+, DRP, DOC, TN, and TP were collected on approximately the same frequency as the reservoir water column chemistry samples (Carey et al. 2021c), and linearly interpolated to a daily time step. 

GLM-AED requires additional solute driver data for inflows, including dissolved silica (Si); particulate organic fractions of C, N, and P; two dissolved organic fractions of C, N and P (labile and recalcitrant); dissolved CH4; and DIC; which were estimated from intermittent grab samples or literature ratios to develop the daily inflow dataset. Specifically, following Wetzel (2001)'s synthesis of the distribution of dissolved, organic, and total fractions of C, N, and P in waterbodies similar to FCR, we assumed that: 1) 10% of the DOC, DON, and DOP pools was labile and 90% was recalcitrant; 2) POC concentrations were 10% of DOC concentrations; 3) DON concentrations were five times greater than PON concentrations; and 4) 30% of total organic P is in the DOP fraction. PON and POP concentrations were determined via subtraction, and DIC and dissolved Si concentrations were set at the median of long-term measurements (Carey et al. 2020, Munger et al. 2016). 

Water chemistry was measured intermittently at Falling Creek, so its daily solute concentrations were calculated from multiplying Tunnel Branch's daily solute concentrations by ratios of the two stream's solutes measured on n=24 days in 2019 (Carey et al. 2021c). 

We represented FCR's hypolimnetic side-stream supersaturation oxygenation system (HOx or SSS) by a submerged inflow in the model. The mass of dissolved oxygen in the submerged inflow matched the mass of dissolved oxygen added in the reservoir as part of HOx operations during the field manipulation, but with a reduced inflow volume (compared to the volume of water pumped through the HOx system) and no other solutes. We simulated the HOx system in this way to recreate how it works in the reservoir: the HOx system in FCR does not affect water balance or thermal structure because it returns the same volume of water it extracts from 8 m in the hypolimnion for oxygenation onshore back to 8 m without altering its temperature (Gerling et al. 2014). Consequently, because GLM-AED can simulate submerged inflows but not outflows, we reduced the inflow volume of the submerged stream to avoid altering the model's water budget. We did not add any solutes (other than dissolved oxygen) in this inflow to ensure that any effects of the HOx system on hypolimnetic chemistry were due to in situ reservoir processes, not inflow chemistry dynamics. The water temperature of this submerged inflow was set to observations of water temperature at 8 m, the depth at which the HOx injects the oxygenated water into the hypolimnion (Gerling et al. 2014).  

Outflow water balance: 
The daily outflow discharge was estimated as the sum of the two surface streams' daily inflow discharge, as the reservoir did not exhibit large changes in water level during the 2013-2019 study and was managed to maintain full pond conditions. The physical and chemical properties of the outflow were determined by the state of the modeled reservoir.

2) Model configuration

We simulated two sediment zones in the model, based on the bathymetry of FCR (Gerling et al. 2014), to represent separate epilimnetic and hypolimnetic sediment dynamics. The two sediment zones had different temperature and heat dynamics, as well as different sediment flux rates for oxygen, NH4+, NO3-, and DRP, following observations by McClure et al. (2020), Gerling et al. (2016), and Krueger et al. (2020) in FCR. Phytoplankton were divided into three groups that represented dominant taxa in FCR: cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae (Carey et al. 2021d).

The total model simulation period was 15 May 2013 to 31 December 2019, which was chosen because the weir on the largest stream inflow was deployed on 14 May 2013. GLM-AED was run on an hourly time step throughout the simulation period, which encompassed a wide range of meteorological conditions, inflow volumes, HOx operation levels, and resulting hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. Initial water column profiles of water temperature and water chemistry were chosen to represent typical conditions observed in the reservoir in May.

The three configuration model configuration files needed to run the model are glm3.nml, aed2_20220111_2DOCpools.nml, and aed2_phyto_pars_4Jan2022.nml.

3) Model calibration 

We divided the total simulation period into calibration (15 May 2013-31 December 2018) and validation (1 January 2019-31 December 2019) periods for model verification.  As GLM-AED is a 1-D model, we focused model calibration on the full depth profile at the deepest site at the reservoir, where the long-term monitoring data were collected (Fig. 9). Earlier studies indicate that oxygen dynamics at the deep site are representative of upstream sites in the reservoir (Gerling et al. 2014, McClure et al. 2018). The monitoring site is immediately adjacent to the reservoir outflow, thereby ensuring that the model accurately captured downstream export of C, N, and P. 

We calibrated GLM-AED to observed conditions in a three-step approach, following Ladwig et al. (2021). First, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify the most important parameters for simulating water temperature, dissolved oxygen, NH4, NO3, PO4, and DOC using the methods of Morris (1991). Second, we calibrated the identified sensitive parameters using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for automated numerical optimization to minimize root mean square error (RMSE) between observations and model output (Hansen 2016), using all sampling depths in the water column (0.1, 1.6, 2.8, 3.8, 5.0, 6.2, 8.0, and 9.0 m). Initial parameter values were set at model defaults (Hipsey et al. 2019) and run for 1000 iterations. Third, since we found strong trade-offs in performance for NH4+ and NO3- automated calibrations, whereby the best parameters for one solute degraded the performance of the other, we manually choose parameter values that exhibited their best combined performance, following Ladwig et al. (2021).
