From 2013 to 2019, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al. (2014). These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018). In 2019, the HOx was activated during the following time periods: 29 June to 11 September, 25 September to 02 December. This hypolimnetic oxygenation schedule is instantiated in the oxygenation inflow file included in this data package.
